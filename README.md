# Rafty - The raft controller

Rafty is an raft controller utilizing a set of commonly available hardware and customized software. The vision of the project is to offer **an low cost and open source** solution to control your rafts heading and motor speed at first hand.

### Current state
 The first version of the controller is under work. I'm currently working on the manual steering.
 
 The idea is to have a few different operation modes such as: Manual steering,Set heading (compass (+GPS) ), GPS Waypoints

### Hardware
*Modules*
- Arduino Mega - [LINK](https://wiki.eprolabs.com/index.php?title=Arduino_Mega_2560)
- oled display, 128x64px (1.3"), I2C

### Installation
//Add installation insturctions here

### ToDo
- Set heading (compass (+GPS) )
- GPS Waypoints
- Trolling motor speed control support

### Ideas
- Steering types: Rudder/turning motor, 2 motors (variable speed, L+R), 
- Custom PCB to accommodate all of the hardware components

### FAQ
*Who should use Rafty?* - Anyone who is interested in building a controller to their raft or anyone who is looking into finding a solution to improve the way of controlling their raft.
