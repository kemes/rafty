# Rafty - The raft controller

Rafty is an raft controller utilizing a set of hardware and software. The project goal is to offer **an low cost and open source** solution to control your rafts direction and speed. The vision is to have a few different modes in which the controller can be set to:
- Manual steering 
- Set heading (compass (+GPS) )
- GPS Waypoints.

### Current state
 The first version of the controller is under work. I'm currently working on the manual steering.
